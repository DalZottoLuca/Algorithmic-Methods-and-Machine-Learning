Computer vision is one of the hottest research fields in
Machine Learning. The goal of this paper is to compare
the effectiveness of some of the most famous classification
algorithms for this kind of problem. In detail, we are
going to face the “Fashion-MNIST” dataset, a collection
of Zalando’s article images, regarding 10 different classes
(pieces of clothing). The analysis involves some simple
algorithms, but also more sophisticated ones, up to a
state-of-the-art approach: in details, Logistic Regression,
KNN, Random Forest, SVM and CNN are considered. The
comparison is carried out from different point of views, in
order to highlight the strengths but also the limits of these
algorithms. The experimental results are mostly in line with
their theoretical characteristics, confirming the superiority
of SVM and CNN in terms of accuracy.
